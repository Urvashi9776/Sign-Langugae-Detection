# Action Detection for Sign Language

## Project Overview
This project focuses on action detection in sign language using machine learning techniques. The main script, `ActionDetectionforSignLanguage.ipynb`, contains the implementation of the model and training process.

## Files in the Repository
- `ActionDetectionforSignLanguage.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for the action detection model.
- `events.out.tfevents.*`: TensorFlow event files containing training logs and metrics. These files are used by TensorBoard for visualization of the training process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Other dependencies (list them here)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ActionDetectionforSignLanguage.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `ActionDetectionforSignLanguage.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook ActionDetectionforSignLanguage.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
