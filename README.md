# ‚úã Action Detection for Sign Language

## üìñ Project Overview

This project focuses on **action detection in sign language** using machine learning techniques. The aim is to recognize and classify sign language gestures from video frames, enabling communication through sign language recognition systems. The model is implemented using **TensorFlow** and trained on a custom dataset for detecting various sign language actions.

The main script, **ActionDetectionforSignLanguage.ipynb**, contains the code for data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## üéØ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the sign language video data, extracting relevant frames and features.
2. **Model Creation**: Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow for action detection, leveraging techniques such as **LSTMs** for sequence modeling and **CNNs** for image feature extraction.
3. **Model Training**: Train the model on the dataset with appropriate hyperparameters, and log the training process.
4. **Evaluation**: Test the trained model on unseen data to assess its accuracy and performance.
5. **Visualization**: Use **TensorBoard** to visualize training metrics such as loss, accuracy, and learning curves.
